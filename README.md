# OnlyDance AR Symfony

The OnlyDance Backend provides the server-side logic and data management for the OnlyDance AR application.  
It handles user-generated dances, authentication, data storage, and serves as the central interface between the AR client and the database.

The backend is designed to be lightweight, secure, and scalable.
